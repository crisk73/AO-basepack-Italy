# AO base pack Italy and Alps
This is a hi-res mesh XP12 compatible base package covering Italy and Alps. Patches are used for some sloped airports (such as Courchevel). I'd like to share those pre-built tiles to be used either with AO or ME.

Hi-res mesh can be found here: [Coverage map viewfinderpanoramas.org](https://viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem1d.html) You need to manually copy elevation data files in each correct XX+XXX folder inside the Elevation_data folder in O4XP.

Settings to pre-build tiles compatible with AO and ME are included. Remember to set skip_download and skip_converts to True in the O4XP App settings.
